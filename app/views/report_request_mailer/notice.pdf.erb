The New York City Charter, Chapter 49, Section 1133, requires that agencies submit to the Department of Records and
Information Services (DORIS) all reports, documents, studies and publications required by local law, executive
order, or mayoral directive to be published, issued, or transmitted to the City Council or Mayor, within 10 business
days of their publication. For any report that is not received within 10 business days of the publication date,
DORIS is required to email the agency to request the report, and to provide the text of that email in place of the
report in the Government Publications Portal.
\smallbreak
Consistent with these requirements, DORIS hereby requests the transmission of the report shown below, which DORIS
has not received as of <%= Date.today %>. Please submit this report to the Government Publications Portal. If you have
questions, please contact staff at the Municipal Library at
